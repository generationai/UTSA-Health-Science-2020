## Motivation and Essential Understandings

Pima Indians living in Mexico have a diabetes prevalence of about 8%, whereas those who have emigrated to the USA, where the lifestyle is more sedentary and access to energy dense (fatty) food is easier, have a diabetes prevalence of about 50% respectively. The N.I.H. believes that if it can understand why the Pima are so obese it can better understand obesity in the rest of us. 

•	Is Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus caused by a person’s environment (i.e., from obesity caused by overnutrition) or by their genetic makeup?

## Context and Dataset
Students in Life & Health Sciences will interpret visualizations using data from the Pima Indian dataset based on a population of women who were at least 21 years old, of Pima Indian heritage and living near Phoenix, Arizona. This population was tested for diabetes according to World Health Organization criteria. Students will use this information to suggest a public health campaign.

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:

•	Describe the Pima Indian population in terms of historical health data

•	Explore correlations associated with diabetes

•	Use data visualizations to explain predictors for diabetes 

•	Apply analysis in the context of creating a public health plan


## Data Science Concepts and Skills 
1.	Summary statistics
2.	Exploratory data analysis; Static data visualization
3.	Data wrangling

## Students
This lesson is for late undergraduate students. Students should be familiar with statistical concepts, basic data visualizations, and have worked in Excel.  

## Time to Teach this Lesson 
This lesson can be taught in 2 sessions using a worksheet
